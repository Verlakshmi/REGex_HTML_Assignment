                Professor Richard Zare in this lab. Whether its summer
                grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on
                your plate, nearly every part of the world you carries
                special chemical maker. These makers called isotopes, can
                tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance 
                are from, where they traveled and what happend to them
                along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex 
                and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new
                method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.
